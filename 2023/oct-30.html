                <h4>October 30th, 2023 at 8:40PM</h4>
                Yes, I installed Arch Linux. I don't have a desktop-environment setup yet, but I will be doing that soon. It boots, it works, I'm happy :D
                <br><br>
                Ok now for the actually important updates, what will I do once I get the domain I want? Well (example.com won't be the domain), lets read below.
                <ul>
                <li>(www.)example.com - Site Homepage.</li>
                <li>status.example.com - Short Updates By Me.</li>
                <li>articles.example.com - Articles I Will Release (like the old blog-post system but better).</li>
                <li>archive.example.com - Archives of content I have made before now (Paint, forum threads, etc).</li>
                <li>videos.example.com - Yes, my own video site I will find a way to host. Videos will probably be only made with fully unique content, probably edits and other cool stuff like that. Comment section maybe will be there too, we will see though.</li>
                <li>music.example.com - Same thing but for music i end up making (if i actually release anything LOL).</li>
                <li>projects.example.com - Projects I am working on whether for a specific group or just myself. More info will be on the pages if it doesn't redirect to another website such as Venith.</li>
                </ul>
                Very nice updates, i can't wait already lol and I only now have just started thinking of this stuff. Videos/Music, Projects, and maybe Articles/Status pages will all work on DSi for damn sure. They'll be hosted on GitHub (except maybe articles/statuses) which means I'll be able to stop forcing HTTPS, which means it'll work on DSi. On DSi for some reason, it normally denies current certificates but for GitHub/Neocities specifically, it just doesn't load at all when you force it. Neocities doesn't allow disabling it, GitHub does though. Could use GitLab/Codeberg too, idk.
                <br><br>
                Main page will stay on Neocities either forever or until I can self-host the website. If I can self-host the website, no shit I'm moving it out of here. Backend is a hell of a lot more useful than pure-frontend even if it can get you pretty far nowadays too. I would love a PHP comment section on my website, but I probably won't have that for a few years. Even if I can self-host, I will wait until I can both do Venith and Digital Cheese stuff at once on servers because I don't have infinite resources to work with here (albeit, I have quite a lot I can use due to wasting too much time online).
